        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          iQuHACK (interdisciplinary Quantum HACKathon) is MIT's first annual quantum hackathon.
          We aim to bring people from a diverse set of backgrounds, including physics, computer science, chemistry, 
          and even arts together to explore improvements and applications of near-term quantum devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          No need to have a background in quantum information! Along with IBM instructors, 
          we will teach you the basics of quantum circuits, algorithms and the types of projects 
          that can be done with IBM's <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>.
          Your projects will be run on a <strong>real quantum computer</strong> hosted by
          <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/experience/">IBM Q Experience</a>!

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>What is MIT iQuHACK?</strong><br />MIT iQuHACK is a hackathon focused on learning about what quantum computers are and how to use them. You can develop anything from quantum games to quantum circuits to quantum algorithms written in Python. You will have the opportunity to run your quantum programs on IBM's real quantum processors.</li>
          <li><strong>Where and when will MIT iQuHACK happen?</strong><br />MIT iQuHACK will be held February 1st - 2nd 2020 on MIT's campus. There will be optional workshops offered on Friday, January 31st 2020.</li>
          <li><strong>Who can participate in iQuHACK?<br /></strong>iQuHACK is open to all students (undergraduate and graduate) and non-faculty university affiliates. While our target audience is mainly individuals affiliated with a university, we welcome all local applicants with a diverse set of interests and backgrounds to apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Do I have to pay to participate at MIT iQuHACK? </strong><br />No, the admission is free. Meals, drinks, and snacks will be provided during the hackathon. You can attend the workshop free of charge even if you're not participating in the hackathon.</li>
          <li><strong>What will I eat?</strong><br />We'll provide all meals from Saturday's Breakfast through Sunday's dinner if you are participating in the hackathon. We will do our best to accommodate any dietary restrictions. There will also be coffee/snacks throughout the hacking period.</li>
          <li><strong>How do I sign up for MIT iQuHACK?</strong><br />You can sign up via <a href="http://iquhack.mit.edu">iquhack.mit.edu</a> or directly on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBXyHTZdonm1WaYmmmpatC_T406KitsbESp_Xj3in_sGHrNw/viewform">form</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>What do I get from participating at MIT iQuHACK?</strong><br />MIT iQuHACK's goal is to extend your knowledge and experience using quantum computers. You'll get the opportunity to learn from and network with experts and other individuals interested in quantum computing. Additionally, you'll have a shot at winning some cool quantum swag items.</li>
          <li><strong>How can I prepare for MIT iQuHACK?</strong><strong><br /></strong>A workshop will be offered on Friday, January 31st 2020, to provide you with the basic knowledge needed to compete in MIT iQuHACK. Additionally, if you are an MIT student, you can enroll in <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/ia20/6.S089/">6.s089</a> which is offered over IAP 2020.<br />Alternatively, you can prepare on your own using online sources and IBM's tutorials (<a href="https://qiskit.org/">https://qiskit.org/</a>); but remember, in the interest of fairness, you can't start working on your project for the hackathon before it begins!</li>
          <li><strong>How will the teams be formed?<br /></strong>Teams must have at least 3 members, and no more than 5 members. Participants are welcome to form teams on their own prior to the event; however, there will be a period at the beginning of the event for official team formation.</li>
          <li><strong>What should I bring to MIT iQuHACK? </strong><br />Bring a valid student ID or government-issued ID for admission. You should bring a wifi capable electronic device that will allow you to write python code (e.g. laptop). We would highly recommend that you install and test the qiskit python package ahead of time. If you like to be comfy, consider bringing something such as a pillow or a blanket.</li>
          <li><strong>Who is hosting MIT iQuHACK?<br /></strong>iQuHACK is hosted by MIT's <strong>Interdisciplinary Quantum Information Science and Engineering </strong>(iQuISE) program, a student led organization of graduate students and post-docs with research interests in experimental and theoretical quantum information science, computation, and communication. For more information about iQuISE send an email to <a href="mailto:iquise-leadership@mit.edu">iquise-leadership@mit.edu</a> or visit <a href="https://www.iquise.mit.edu/">https://www.iquise.mit.edu/</a>.</li>
          </ol>
